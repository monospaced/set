# Opportunity roadmap

This roadmap is intentionally fluid: items can move freely between `NOW`, `NEXT`, and `LATER` as priorities and discoveries change.

## Now

What we're working on now.

## Next

What we could be working on next.

## Later

Everything we could attempt given sufficient time and resources.

#### Semantic color evolution

- rose = favorite
- blue = ai
- spring = live
- chartreuse = highlight
- orange = pending

### Component evolution

#### Factory

- `Control/Listbox` (JS required, selection semantics)
- `Control/Select` (native select with thin styling)
- `Control/Form` (if it becomes a real stateful runtime abstraction)
- `Control/Tag` (delete, remove, select)
- `Status/Progress` (updating)
- `Status/Skeleton` (resolve to loaded)
- `Status/Toast` (dismissible, timer)
- `Structure/Accordion` (JS for exclusive)
- `Structure/Breadcrumb` (JS responsive)
- `Structure/Code` (copy to clipboard)
- `Structure/Tabs` (JS required, a11y)

#### Size gaps

- Missing lg: Alert, Badge, Checkbox, Input, Menu, Nav, Radios, Range, Textarea, Sidebar
- Missing sm: Blockquote
- No size prop: Card, Details, Fieldset, Prose
- Button & Link with size lg are the same as size md if 1. appearance text and label visible or 2. appearance outline or solid, and label hidden.

### CLI bootstrap tool (`@monospaced/set`)

Scope a `set` bootstrap CLI for fast project scaffolding with sensible defaults for tokens, components, and optional assets. Allow brand selection and support tree-shaking.

### Version documentation

Post first release, serve the latest release at `/`, `main` at `/next/*`, and pinned older releases at `/v0.x/*`. Each release publishes an immutable static archive proxied from the main site via `_redirects`; until then the docs (and bundled Storybook) stay a single rolling tier built from `main`.

### Vite 8 upgrade

A coordinated upgrade, not a lone bump: Vite 8 requires `@vitejs/plugin-react` 6, and currently breaks the Storybook build. Tackle as one deliberate PR — verify Storybook and the Eleventy/vitest toolchain against Vite 8 — and unignore both Dependabot majors when starting.

### Style Dictionary DTCG 2025.10 gaps

[Support for DTCG v2025.10](https://github.com/style-dictionary/style-dictionary/issues/1590)

- Revisit bridge-side DTCG `$dimension`/`$duration` normalization once Style Dictionary fully supports nested `{value, unit}` in composite CSS transforms:
  - remove `normalizeDtcgValueObjects` compatibility shim from `prepare-sd-sources.mjs` when safe
- Revisit resolver bridge scope once Style Dictionary lands native DTCG resolver support:
  - reduce/remove custom resolver->SD source adaptation where SD can natively consume resolver semantics
  - consider extracting `resolveAllContextPermutations` into a single module-level call shared by `prepare-sd-contexts.mjs` and `prepare-json-output.mjs` — eliminates duplicate resolution and stage drift risk. May be obsolete if SD's native consumption removes the per-stage iteration entirely.

### Vue framework adapter

Validate that the `packages/adapter` SPEC walker and emitter generalises by authoring a second emitter alongside `src/react`. A small archetype floor (Button, Banner, Page, Menu — pass-through + slotted + CE + events).

### iOS / Android token emit targets

Speculative. Style Dictionary ships built-in iOS Swift, Android XML, and Compose formats; adding them potentially an SD platform extension on top of the existing CSS pipeline.
