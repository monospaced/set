# Opportunity roadmap

This roadmap is intentionally fluid: items can move freely between `NOW`, `NEXT`, and `LATER` as priorities and discoveries change.

## Now

What we're working on now.

### Safari bug

Cause. Your instinct about the Safari update is right. The Safari 27 release notes list a batch of changes to how aspect-ratio flex items are sized, including "fixed aspect-ratio intrinsic-size handling in flex layout to align with the specification" and several fixes for flex items with definite cross sizes and percentage-sized children. The Set lightswitch's icon wrapper is exactly that pattern. It has only a block size and relies on aspect-ratio: 1 / 1 to derive its inline size, and its SVG child is 100% in both axes. Safari 27 now sizes the wrapper from that content instead of the transferred square, so the toggle balloons and the utilities cluster stops shrink-wrapping it.

The real fix belongs in set-core: give .icon-wrapper an explicit inline-size per size variant rather than relying on the aspect-ratio transfer, and ideally avoid the cyclic 100% sizing on .set-icon[data-size=fill] inside it. Other Set components that use the same wrapper pattern, such as buttons with icons, are worth checking in Safari 27 too. Once that ships, the override comment says to remove it.

## Next

What we could be working on next.

## Later

Everything we could attempt given sufficient time and resources.

### Icon weight

Consider 80% icon opacity when paired with text.

### Semantic color evolution

- rose = favorite
- blue = ai
- chartreuse = highlight

### Component evolution

#### Poster Video

Add cover fit to `Video`, and `PosterVideo` support to `Poster`.

#### Factory

- `Control/Listbox` (JS required, selection semantics)
- `Control/Select` (native select with thin styling)
- `Control/Form` (if it becomes a real stateful runtime abstraction)
- `Control/Tag` (delete, remove, select)
- `Status/Progress` (updating)
- `Status/Skeleton` (resolve to loaded)
- `Status/Toast` (dismissible, timer)
- `Structure/Accordion` (JS for exclusive)
- `Structure/Breadcrumb` (JS responsive)
- `Structure/Code` (copy to clipboard)
- `Structure/Tabs` (JS required, a11y)

#### Size gaps

- Missing lg: Alert, Badge, Checkbox, Input, Menu, Nav, Radios, Range, Textarea, Sidebar
- Missing sm: Blockquote
- No size prop: Card, Details, Fieldset, Prose
- Button, Link with size lg are the same as size md if 1. appearance text and label visible or 2. appearance outline or solid, and label hidden.
- Lightswitch with size lg is the same as size md if appearance is outline or solid.

### CLI bootstrap tool (`@monospaced/set`)

Scope a `set` bootstrap CLI for fast project scaffolding with sensible defaults for tokens, components, and optional assets. Allow brand selection and support tree-shaking.

### Version documentation

Post first release, serve the latest release at `/`, `main` at `/next/*`, and pinned older releases at `/v0.x/*`. Each release publishes an immutable static archive proxied from the main site via `_redirects`; until then the docs (and bundled Storybook) stay a single rolling tier built from `main`.

### Vite 8 upgrade

A coordinated upgrade, not a lone bump: Vite 8 requires `@vitejs/plugin-react` 6, and currently breaks the Storybook build. Tackle as one deliberate PR — verify Storybook and the Eleventy/vitest toolchain against Vite 8 — and unignore both Dependabot majors when starting.

### Style Dictionary DTCG 2025.10 gaps

[Support for DTCG v2025.10](https://github.com/style-dictionary/style-dictionary/issues/1590)

- Revisit bridge-side DTCG `$dimension`/`$duration` normalization once Style Dictionary fully supports nested `{value, unit}` in composite CSS transforms:
  - remove `normalizeDtcgValueObjects` compatibility shim from `prepare-sd-sources.mjs` when safe
- Revisit resolver bridge scope once Style Dictionary lands native DTCG resolver support:
  - reduce/remove custom resolver->SD source adaptation where SD can natively consume resolver semantics
  - consider extracting `resolveAllContextPermutations` into a single module-level call shared by `prepare-sd-contexts.mjs` and `prepare-json-output.mjs` — eliminates duplicate resolution and stage drift risk. May be obsolete if SD's native consumption removes the per-stage iteration entirely.

### Vue framework adapter

Validate that the `packages/adapter` SPEC walker and emitter generalises by authoring a second emitter alongside `src/react`. A small archetype floor (Button, Banner, Page, Menu — pass-through + slotted + CE + events).

### iOS / Android token emit targets

Speculative. Style Dictionary ships built-in iOS Swift, Android XML, and Compose formats; adding them potentially an SD platform extension on top of the existing CSS pipeline.
