## Abstract

This document describes the technical specification for design token color values and opacity.

## Status of This Document

This specification was published by the Design Tokens Community Group. It is not a W3C Standard nor is it on the W3C Standards Track. Please note that under the W3C Community Final Specification Agreement (FSA) other conditions apply. Learn more about W3C Community and Business Groups.

This section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication. Other documents may supersede this document. A list of current W3C Community Group reports and the latest revision of this report can be found in the W3C Community Group reports index at https://www.w3.org/community/reports/.

This document was published by the DTCG as a Candidate Recommendation following the definitions provided by the W3C process. Contributions to this draft are governed by Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA), as specified by the W3C Community Group Process.

While not a W3C recommendation, this classification is intended to clarify that, after extensive consensus-building, this specification is intended for implementation.

This specification is considered stable. Further updates will be provided in superseding specifications.

GitHub Issues are preferred for discussion of this specification.

## 1. Conformance

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

The key words MAY, MUST, and MUST NOT in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 Color Tokens

Color tokens can be used to represent colors in different color spaces. Colors represented in tokens can then be converted to other color spaces by translation tools.

Generally speaking, this module uses CSS Color Module Level 4 for reference to concepts and terminology. CSS Color Module Level 4 is a W3C Working Draft and is not a final specification. It is subject to change and may not be implemented in all browsers or platforms.

Color is a complex topic. CSS Color Module Level 4 provides a comprehensive baseline:

- It provides a definition of common color spaces, including gamuts and component coordinates
- It gives technical specifications for translating colors between color spaces
- Its authors are experts in the field of color science
- As a spec it must reach an extremely high standard of implementability and precision

Using this spec as a reference allows us to focus on the design and implementation of the tokens themselves, rather than the underlying color science.

It is not an endorsement of CSS as a default implementation for color tokens.

## 3. Color terminology

This section provides a high-level overview of the terminology used in the specification and how it relates to color science and colorimetry.

Color space

A color space is a specific organization of colors, which helps in the reproduction of color in both physical and digital realms. It defines a range of colors that can be represented and manipulated.

Color model

A color model is a mathematical representation of colors within a specific color space. It defines how colors are represented as numerical values, typically using components.

Color gamut

A color gamut is the complete range of colors that can be represented in a specific color space. It defines the limits of color reproduction for that space.

Component

A component is a single value that defines a part of a color in a specific color space. For example, in the RGB color space, the components are red, green, and blue.

Hue

Hue is the attribute of a color that allows it to be classified as red, green, blue, etc. In many color spaces, hue is represented as an angle on a color wheel. Different color spaces may position colors differently on the wheel.

Saturation

Saturation is the colorfulness of a color relative to its own brightness. It describes how much gray is present in a color. A fully saturated color has no gray, while a desaturated color appears more grayish. It is inherently tied to both chroma and lightness, especially in models like HSL or HSV. A color can be highly saturated but still appear light or dark depending on its lightness.

Lightness

Lightness is the perceived brightness of a color. It describes how light or dark a color appears.

Chroma

Chroma refers to the colorfulness of a color relative to the brightness of a similarly illuminated white. It measures how pure or intense a color appears. In the CIE LCH color model (Lightness, Chroma, Hue), Chroma is independent of lightness and expresses how far a color is from neutral gray along the chromatic axis.

Alpha

Alpha is a component that represents the transparency of a color. It defines how opaque or transparent a color is, with the minimum value (usually 0) being fully transparent and the maximum value (usually 1) being fully opaque.

## 4. Color type

Represents a color.

### 4.1 Format

For color tokens, the $type property MUST be set to the string color.

The $value property can then be used to specify the details of the color, The $value object contains the following properties:

- colorSpace (required): A string that specifies the color space or color model. For supported color spaces, see the supported color spaces section below.
- components (required): An array representing the color components. The number of components depends on the color space. Each element of the array MUST be either:
  - A number
  - The 'none' keyword

- alpha (optional): A number that represents the alpha value of the color. This value is between 0 and 1, where 0 is fully transparent and 1 is fully opaque. If omitted, the alpha value of the color MUST be assumed to be 1 (fully opaque).
- hex (optional): A string that represents a fallback value of the color. The fallback color MUST be formatted in 6 digit CSS hex color notation format to avoid conflicts with the provided alpha value.

```
{
  "Hot pink": {
    "$type": "color",
    "$value": {
      "colorSpace": "srgb",
      "components": [1, 0, 1],
      "alpha": 1,
      "hex": "#ff00ff"
    }
  },
  "Translucent shadow": {
    "$type": "color",
    "$value": {
      "colorSpace": "srgb",
      "components": [0, 0, 0],
      "alpha": 0.5,
      "hex": "#000000"
    }
  }
}
```

#### 4.1.1 The none keyword

When specifying a color in some color spaces, a value of 0 could be ambiguous. For example, in the HSL color space, colors with a hue of 0 are red; while a single color like hsl(0, 0, 50) would not be rendered as red, it may be treated as a completely desaturated red when interpolated with other colors. Therefore, in certain color spaces, 0 is insufficient to indicate that there is no value for a given component.

CSS Color Module Level 4 has introduced the none keyword to indicate that a component is missing, or not applicable. For example, in the HSL color space, the none keyword may be used to indicate that there is no angle value for the color; a color with a hue value of none MAY be rendered differently from a color with a hue angle of 0, or result in different colors when interpolating.

##### 4.1.1.1 Using the none keyword

The none keyword MAY be used in the components array to indicate that a component is not applicable or not specified.

```
{
  "White": {
    "$type": "color",
    "$value": {
      "colorSpace": "hsl",
      "components": ["none", 0, 100],
      "alpha": 1,
      "hex": "#ffffff"
    }
  }
}
```

Contrast this with the following example where the Hue is specified as 0:

```
{
  "White": {
    "$type": "color",
    "$value": {
      "colorSpace": "hsl",
      "components": [0, 0, 100],
      "alpha": 1,
      "hex": "#ffffff"
    }
  }
}
```

While both examples will render as white, the first example is more explicit about the fact that the hue is not applicable. This is important when interpolating between colors or mixing colors, where using colors with components of 0 or none can yield different results.

### 4.2 Supported Color spaces

The following values are supported for the colorSpace property. The components array will vary depending on the color space.

In this table, brackets [] indicate that an extrema are included, parentheses () indicate that the extrema are excluded. For example, in the HSL color space, hue is in the range of [0 - 360], which means that 0 MAY be used but 360 MUST NOT be used.

The examples below have varying degrees of precision (i.e. numbers after the decimal). This is done to ensure that the fallback color is exactly the same as the defined color when converted to HEX. In practice, the numbers used to define each component can have any degree of precision.

The examples below are given with all optional values (alpha, hex) included for the purpose of completeness. Defining the alpha property for fully-opaque colors is not required, see #format.

To provide a logically consistent approach without creating ambiguity around the format, this spec takes the following approach:

- If CSS Color Module 4 allows a color space to be referenced by both a named function (like srgb()) and a keyword in the color() function, use the format intended for the color() function.
- If CSS Color Module 4 only defines a color space either as a named function (like hwb()) or a keyword in the color() function (like rec-2020), use the syntax indicated.
- If CSS Color Module 4 allows both unit values (like 50) and percentages (like 50%) for a component, use the unit value.

Using this spec as a reference allows us to focus on the design and implementation of the tokens themselves, rather than the underlying color science.

#### 4.2.1 sRGB

### 4.3 Future color space support

Future versions of this spec may add support for additional color spaces, depending on adoption and support in design tools.

## 5. Gamut mapping

This section is non-normative.

Gamut mapping is the process of converting colors from one color space to another.

Gamut mapping is necessary when the source color space has a larger gamut than the target color space. This can happen when converting colors from a wide-gamut color space (like Display-P3) to a smaller gamut color space (like sRGB). Gamut mapping ensures that the colors are represented accurately in the target color space, even if some colors cannot be represented exactly.

When transforming colors, translation tools MAY use the gamut mapping algorithm that best fits the use case. For example, if the goal is to preserve the appearance of colors, a perceptual gamut mapping algorithm may be used. If the goal is to preserve the exact color values, a saturation or relative colorimetric gamut mapping algorithm may be used.

Token authors should be aware that the choice of gamut mapping algorithm can significantly affect the appearance of colors in the target color space. If colors need to be transformed between color spaces, it's important to validate the output of the translation tool to ensure that the colors are represented accurately and consistently.

## 6. Interpolation

This section is non-normative.

In many cases, colors may be interpolated, or blended, to create new colors. For example, when creating a gradient, colors are often interpolated between two or more key colors.

Interpolation can be done in different color spaces, and the choice of color space can affect the appearance of the resulting colors. Translation tools MAY use different interpolation methods depending on the color space and the desired effect. Authors should be aware of the implications of interpolation in different color spaces and validate interpolated colors to ensure they meet design requirements.

## 7. Token naming

This section is non-normative.

### 7.1 Categorization

There are 3 main categories of design tokens that we will continue to reference in this specification.

#### 7.1.1 Base

Base tokens are the lowest level tokens.

```
{
  "color": {
    "green": {
      "$type": "color",
      "$value": {
        "colorSpace": "srgb",
        "components": [0.67, 0.79, 0.74]
      }
    },
    "shadow": {
      "$type": "color",
      "$value": {
        "colorSpace": "srgb",
        "components": [0, 0, 0],
        "alpha": 0.53
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 7.1.2 Alias

A design token’s value MAY be a reference to another token. The same value MAY have multiple names or aliases.

```
{
  "color": {
    "palette": {
      "black": {
        "$type": "color",
        "$value": {
          "colorSpace": "srgb",
          "components": [0, 0, 0]
        }
      }
    },
    "text": {
      "base": {
        "$value": "{color.palette.black}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 7.1.3 Component

Component-specific tokens provide design decisions at the component level and improve the separation of concerns in your token architecture.

```
{
  "color": {
    "button": {
      "primary": {
        "$value": "{color.brand.primary}"
      }
    },
    "banner": {
      "background": {
        "$value": "{color.palette.black}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 7.2 Naming strategies

There are many naming options when it comes to design tokens, especially color type tokens. We’ve identified two that seem to be most commonly implemented, descriptive and numerical.

#### 7.2.1 Base Tokens

For Base tokens, here’s how they MAY be represented in each version:

##### 7.2.1.1 Descriptive

Descriptive names can be more emotional and human-friendly because they often relate to tangible things that people interact with, like grass or watermelon.

```
{
  "color": {
    "grass": {
      "$type": "color",
      "$value": {
        "colorSpace": "srgb",
        "components": [0.67, 0.79, 0.74]
      }
    },
    "brand": {
      "watermelon": {
        "$type": "color",
        "$value": {
          "colorSpace": "srgb",
          "components": [0.91, 0.28, 0.42]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

##### 7.2.1.2 Numerical

###### 7.2.1.2.1 Ordered scales

Numerical tokens often follow a scale to help delineate how the colors progress. For example, when using an ordered scale, color.blue.500 may be the base color, where the lightest color value is color.blue.100, and the darkest value could be color.blue.900, and these values are ordered in increments of 100s in between. We recommend not using sequential numbers (ex: 1, 2, 3, 4) for scalability in case future colors need to be added in between two existing colors.

```
{
  "color": {
    "green": {
      "400": {
        "$type": "color",
        "$value": {
          "colorSpace": "srgb",
          "components": [0.42, 0.73, 0.63]
        }
      },
      "500": {
        "$type": "color",
        "$value": {
          "colorSpace": "srgb",
          "components": [0.15, 0.56, 0.42]
        }
      },
      "600": {
        "$type": "color",
        "$value": {
          "colorSpace": "srgb",
          "components": [0.07, 0.5, 0.36]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Numerical token names can also allow for further specificity when needed. For example, when creating neutral palette tokens (like grays), the scale may increase by increments of 25 instead of 100 at the lightest values, and then increment by 100 thereafter.

```
{
  "color": {
    "gray": {
      "25": {
        "$type": "color",
        "$value": {
          "colorSpace": "srgb",
          "components": [0.93, 0.93, 0.93],
        },
      },
      "50": {
        "$type": "color",
        "$value": {
          "colorSpace": "srgb",
          "components": [0.87, 0.87, 0.87],
        },
      },
      "75": {
        "$type": "color",
        "$value": {
          "colorSpace": "srgb",
          "components": [0.8, 0.8, 0.8],
        },
      },
      "100": {
        "$type": "color",
        "$value": {
          "colorSpace": "srgb",
          "components": [0.73, 0.73, 0.73],
        },
      },
      // etc...
    },
  },
}
```

###### 7.2.1.2.2 Bounded scales

Numerical tokens can also be named through bounded scales. These tokens utilize a distinguishing value based on the actual color used for the token, such as in HSL’s lightness value to vary shades of a tint.

```
{
  "color": {
    "gray": {
      "22": {
        "$type": "color",
        "$value": {
          "colorSpace": "hsl",
          "components": [0, 0, 22]
        }
      },
      "49": {
        "$type": "color",
        "$value": {
          "colorSpace": "hsl",
          "components": [0, 0, 49]
        }
      },
      "73": {
        "$type": "color",
        "$value": {
          "colorSpace": "hsl",
          "components": [0, 0, 73]
        }
      },
      "99": {
        "$type": "color",
        "$value": {
          "colorSpace": "hsl",
          "components": [0, 0, 99]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

###### 7.2.1.2.3 Computer generated scales

Token names MAY also be generated by tools, where the user specifies the base name, and the tool appends scale numbers based on changes to the underlying value.

```
// User specified name: color-green
// Tool generated names for 6 steps of opacity
{
  "color": {
    "green": {
      "10": {
        "$type": "color",
        "$value": {
          "colorSpace": "srgb",
          "components": [0.13, 0.7, 0.67],
          "alpha": 0.1,
        },
      },
      "20": {
        "$type": "color",
        "$value": {
          "colorSpace": "srgb",
          "components": [0.13, 0.7, 0.67],
          "alpha": 0.2,
        },
      },
      // etc...
    },
  },
}
```

#### 7.2.2 Alias Tokens

For Alias Tokens, we recommend grouping tokens with similar intentions by prioritizing the category + property within the name. For example, all background color Alias tokens would likely start with color.background.XXX.

We recommend avoiding abbreviations. For example, use “background” instead of “bg”, to help with clarity.

Here’s how alias tokens may be represented:

```
{
  "color": {
    "background": {
      "error": {
        "$value": "{color.red.600}"
      },
      "success": {
        "$value": "{color.green.400}"
      }
    },
    "text": {
      "base": {
        "$value": "{color.palette.black}"
      },
      "errorHover": {
        "$value": "{color.red.700}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Color alias tokens could also be grouped by concept, like so:

```
// These can be used for background, border, or text colors
{
  "color": {
    "background": {
      "error": {
        "$value": "{color.red.600}",
      },
      "success": {
        "$value": "{color.green.400}",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

#### 7.2.3 Component Tokens

Component-specific names should start with the component they support and be located close to the component code. They commonly refer to alias tokens and can be helpful when trying to use consistent styles across components while still maintaining separation of concerns.

```
{
  "color": {
    "badge": {
      "background": {
        "error": {
          "$value": "{color.background.error}"
        },
        "success": {
          "$value": "{color.background.success}"
        }
      },
      "text": {
        "error": {
          "$value": "{color.text.error}"
        },
        "success": {
          "$value": "{color.text.success}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
